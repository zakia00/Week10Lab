## Challenges

•	What vulnerabilities were beyond the control of the user?
Ans: Social-Engineering Attacks were beyond the control of the user. Because the attackers revealed the password reset link by treating as an actual user and customer care representatives helped him to do that unconsciously. Moreover, the technical lacking and bad design of the Apple and Amazon, for example, putting 4 digit of the credit card number and billing address to recover the password, were something that the user could not control to save himself.  

•	What if anything could have been done by the user to mitigate the severity of the attack?
Ans: The user could have a backup for all his materials and files stored in the system. He could also use two step authentication system to make the exploit hard for the attacker.

Now, think back to the fake Facebook login scenario above. Assuming a successful compromise, in which the user's Facebook username and password were successfully intercepted, answer the following:
•	What could the user do to mitigate this, making a successful login impossible for the attacker even with the credentials? (Hint: FB offers this as an option; not all sites do)
Ans: User could use two step authentication method to mitigate the problem.

•	Why might the username/password still be of value to the attacker even if she can't use them to login to Facebook? (Hint: think about how users come up with passwords)
Ans: If the attacker gets the username and password of facebook, it could help the attacker to attack other sites and accounts used by that user. The attacker could easily guess the credentials for other sites of that user.
